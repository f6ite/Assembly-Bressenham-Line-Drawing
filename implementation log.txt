13/11 
- Implemented DrawPixel function as per the tutorial

15/11 
- Completed the implementation of drawing a single coloured line

18/11 
- Removed line drawing implementation because it didn't use the Bresenham Algorithm and didn't work in a larger loop.
- Completed the Bresenham Line Algorithm as per the psuedo code

19/11 
- Completed the Bresenham Line Algorithm loop
- Implemented draw line, but it doesn't draw anything for some reason


20/11
- Created a DrawPixel command that looped and created mutiple pixels, however the calculations were off and it only drew 3 pixels and no lines
- Fixed the DrawPixel command to make lines rather than just single pixels
- Remade the Bresenham algorithm and included it inside the entry function to flow better and use less jumps
- Encounted strange occurence when making a loop, the lines start from the opposite side of the screen when they go off the edge
- Made the program produce hundreds of lines originating from different point, unsure if this meets the spec, will continue to experiment with looping
